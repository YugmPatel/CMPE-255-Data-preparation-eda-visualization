# CMPE-255-Data-preparation-eda-visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the exploration, data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling of two popular Kaggle datasets: a diverse tabular dataset and a time series dataset. Each dataset undergoes a series of steps, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, and anomaly detection. Various machine learning models are then built using AutoML tools, including ensemble models. The projectâ€™s results are organized in a GitHub repository.

## Datasets Used
1. **Tabular Dataset**: NYC Taxi / Airbnb dataset, or another Kaggle dataset with diverse data types.
2. **Time Series Dataset**: Any time series dataset suitable for forecasting or temporal analysis from Kaggle.

## Project Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
   - Conducted in-depth EDA to understand the dataset structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.
   - Used visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create detailed visualizations.
   - Leveraged Auto EDA and Auto DS tools to augment manual insights.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
   - Performed comprehensive data cleaning, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and managing outliers.
   - Applied anomaly detection and clustering techniques to identify unusual patterns and remove anomalies.
   - Conducted data imputation to manage any missing data effectively.

### 3. Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
   - Created new features relevant to each dataset to improve model accuracy.
   - Selected significant features using various feature selection techniques to optimize model performance.

### 4. Model Building with AutoML
   - Implemented multiple machine learning models, including classification and regression models (based on dataset requirements).
   - Used AutoVIML for AutoML model selection and tuning, focusing on ensemble models to enhance accuracy.

### 5. Clustering and Anomaly Detection
   - Performed clustering analysis to group similar data points and understand inherent structures in the data.
   - Used anomaly detection to identify and eliminate outliers that could negatively impact model performance.

## Results and Insights
- Detailed insights into data distributions, relationships, and anomalies.
- Cleaned and processed datasets ready for model training.
- Machine learning models with optimal features, including ensemble models, with evaluation metrics.
